## Installation

Before anything be sure to start the back end server and set up your database. Click [here](http://github.com/amiratak88/eatup-server) for the server's repository.

Once you're done setting up the API, follow these steps:

- Use this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. 

- Fork and clone this repository.

- Navigate to the root folder of the cloned repo in you terminal and run this command:
```
npm instal && npm start
```
- Enter **y** for yes if you were prompted with this question:

- If you see something similar to this, you have successfully booted up the client server and it should be running on port **3001**.
